	<h1>Storyline of Castaway Wars</h1>
	
	<img src="Karte_Castaway_Wars_2_0.jpg" alt="picture island map"/>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>A mayor number of people stranded on the island. After attempts to build a stable community 
		failed due to serious differences of ideas for island and community policies, the group 
		split up into several fractions, which are mostly hostile towards each other.</p>
	
	<h2>Timeline</h2>
	<p>YC means Years in the Castaway's timeline. 0-1-1 YC was the day when the first 
	people arrived on the island. BYC is before this. Since none of the first castaways knew 
	how much time had passed, they built their own calendar. This was then adopted by all 
	castaways who arrived later, because most of them didn't know the exact date either.</p>
	<h3>early phase:</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<li>0-0-some days BYC: beginning of the stormy phase</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: 4:00 am: A ship sinks in the storm near the island.</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: afternoon: people from that ship make it to beacon beach 
			and immediately fall asleep, terribly exhausted.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 7:30 am: first person wakes up. No idea how much time had passed.
			person starts waking up the others.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 9:40 am: everyone present woken up. Mostly healthy. Attempts to gather 
			status informations.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 10:13 am: Status information gathered: 
		<ul>
			<li>no advanced equipment, only steel knives</li>
			<li>drinkable water available</li>
			<li>fruit, rabbits and birds available for food</li>
			<li>no sign of dangerous animals</li>
			<li>no sign of any kind of human presence</li>
			<li>no short or mid-term ways of escaping this island (probably an island)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>0-1-2 YC: set up of first signal fire</li>
		<li>0-1-3 YC: start hunting wild pigs in the near part of the vast forest</li>
		<li>0-1-6 YC: start of political disagreements: just wait to be saved, build homes,
			or live nomadic and have fun</li>
		<li>0-1-10 YC: nomad lovers split away, however, not many women join them</li>
		<li>0-1-11 YC: nomads split up into two fractions due to cultural disagreements, party 
			with higher culture refered to as wood runners, party with lower culture called
			barbarians. Almost all nomad women join the wood runners</li>
		<li>0-1-12 YC: barbarians split up into two tribes due to leadership disagreements</li>
		<li>0-1-14 YC: home lovers split away into the forest, become beach-side-huttese</li>
		<li>0-1-16 YC: a barbarian tribe attacks beacon beach in order to capture women. 
			The barbarians are from now on considered and called savages</li>
		<li>0-1-17 YC: beacon guards' scouts start searching a safer place for the children</li>
		<li>0-2-13 YC: beacon guards' scouts find Grand castle</li>
		<li>0-2-16 YC: beacon guards children and their parents move to Grand castle. 
			However, most adult beacon guards, which are not parents, stay at beacon beach, 
			because still a considerable number of people strand there every week and the 
			beacon guards don't want those people to be recruited by savages.</li>
		<li>0-3-9 YC: end of stormy phase. Although fewer people now strand at beacon beach, 
			the beacon guards still remain there hoping that signal fires could be more
			easily seen if they were at varios places on the island, not only at grand castle.</li>
		<li>0-4-4 YC: unsatisfied by the current living standards of huttese, some of them split
			away to settle elsewhere. They build a fort on a hill and become known as fortese.</li>
		<li>0-11-25 YC: beginning of a new stormy phase</li>
		<li>1-1-12 YC: since a large number of castaways stranded at beacon beach during the last few 
			days, beacon guards send couriers to grand castle in order to call for troops to 
			escort the newly arrived families to security in grand castle.</li>
		<li>1-3-7 YC: end of new stormy phase. Stormy phases now thought to occur regularly
			every year. This is actually true and due to the season.</li>
		<li>3-3-12 YC: Venice castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>4-11-13 YC: castellan scouts find first cliff-side-huttese village, they are
			accepted there, because they help defending the castellan woods from savages</li>
		<li>7-6-12 YC: Rock castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>18-1-1 YC: Council of castellans decides that every castle specializes in at 
			least one special topic: Rock castle: martial arts and guns, Venice castle: 
			ships, Grand castle: animal taming and various advanced technologies</li>

	<h2>important events</h2>
	<p>Some events require a longer description than what would be possible in the timeline. These events are explained
		here in detail.</p>
	
	<h3>the savage strike force, 53-06-17 YC</h3>
	<p>"The savage strike force" was a short-term alliance of three savage tribes to attack a group of castellans. Despite
		the savages not working together very well (still some internal fighting), they were the largest group
		of cooperating savages ever reported.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>Nine years ago, the castellans recruited the martial arts grandmaster. Now, a relatively large strikeforce, with
		every member having ample martial arts training, quits rock castle with the mission to recover knives and guns
		from the savages. They are a little over-confident in their skills and therefore act a little overaggressively.
		They think they can already work towards the known long-time-goal of rock castle: wiping out all savages on
		the island. Therefore, the castellan strike force causes considerable damage to various savage tribes. The
		savages, of course, are not amused by this, and a large grey tribe (that may have been the union of two or
		even three grey tribes anyway) decides to try and rally as many unharmed nearby tribes as possible. They
		get the support of two other tribes (whose colour is still unconfirmed and disputed) and together, the three
		tribes become a what will be known as "the savage strike force", a strike force with the specified goal to
		defeat this specific castellan strike force.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>The savages attack the castellans sometime during the morning or early afternoon. (The historians couldn't find a
		consensus on when exactly the battle started, nor could they definitely figure out where the battle took place.
		Some claim it must have been in the forest, because the survivors remembered frantic fighting between trees, others
		argue that it must have been on savage beach or a hillside because such a large savage force couldn't have been
		coordinated between the trees, and the fight memories with trees originated from some fights while retreating.)
		The castellans don't immediately realise how large the attacking force really is, and decide to fight back.
		Despite the savages theoretically working together, there is a lot of distrust between the members of the tribes,
		and, as a result, they sometimes fight each other and not the castellans, but still most fight the castellans.
		When castellan castualties start to rise, and still more and more savages pour into the fight, the castellans
		suddenly realise that they can probably not win this battle. They decide to retreat. The savages immediately start
		to pursue the retreating castellans, and do not cease this pursue until the castellans retreat into rock castle.
		However, with the start of the pursuit, the trust between the tribes ceases definitely, and the two smaller tribes
		leave the alliance and the grey tribe continues alone.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p>The castellan strike force lost 3/4 of their members, including the commander. The savages too, had high losses,
		since the castellans DID have a large and powerful strike force. Everyone on the island was surprised that the
		savages could form a large group like this. The savages could have declared the whole operation to have been
		a success, but regarding the high losses and the lack of trust inside the alliance, the grey tribe decided to
		not proclaim a great victory. On the castellan side, nobody wanted to declare a victory, although the lieutnant
		refused to call it a defeat, pointing out that the castellan strike force performed a rather good retreat despite
		the loss of the commander, once	they decided to retreat, also the survivors brought back one loaded gun,
		plus the savage losses had been a lot higher. Nevertheless, it felt like a defeat to the castellans, and
		castellan strike forces have become a lot more cautious, and will never again try to fight back when directly
		attacked by a savage army.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Battle of the Burned Hills, 108-5-6 YC noon until 108-5-8 YC morning</h3>
	<p>The "Battle of the Burned Hills" was the largest and most devastating battle that ever occurred on the
		island. Not only did hundrets of people die, also the survivors and those who cleaned up the mess afterwards
		were left heavily traumatized.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p></p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p></p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p></p>
	
			The area around two hills near beacon beach and near the woods becomes the location
			of the most devastating battle ever: <br>
			One hill is inhabited by fortese. The other hill is inhabited by rebels from multiple castles.
			The rebels are being attacked by an united castellan army. The fortese currently host a meeting of some
			allied fortese and huttese. The fort gets attacked by two different wood runner clans, because some
			days ago the fortese cut some wood in the border area of those two clans (presumably firewood for the
			meeting).  Freakily enough at the same time, multiple uncoordinated savage tribes attack the two hills
			in attempts to capture them for themselves, while other savage tribes coincidentally attacked beacon
			beach nearby. As a result, the whole area became an enormous battlefield. Because the fortese and huttese,
			who had been part of the meeting, didn't return (trapped in the fort), the fortese and huttese that had
			stayed at home suspected a huge betrayal by the hosting fortese, and started attacking the area as well.
			-LAter: more savages join, one latecomer group joins (to pressure the savages),

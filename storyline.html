		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>The Story Lorem Ipsim</p>
		
		<h2>Timeline</h2>
		<p>YC means Years in the Castaway's timeline. 0-1-1 YC was the day when the first 
		people arrived on the island. BYC is before this. Since none of the first castaways knew 
		how much time had passed, they built their own calendar. This was then adopted by all 
		castaways who arrived later, because most of them didn't know the exact date either.</p>

	<h1>Storyline of Castaway Wars</h1>
	
	<img src="Karte_Castaway_Wars_2_0.jpg" alt="picture island map"/>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>A mayor number of people stranded on the island. After attempts to build a stable community 
		failed due to serious differences of ideas for island and community policies, the group 
		split up into several fractions, which are mostly hostile towards each other.</p>
	
	<h2>Timeline</h2>
	<p>YC means Years in the Castaway's timeline. 0-1-1 YC was the day when the first 
	people arrived on the island. BYC is before this. Since none of the first castaways knew 
	how much time had passed, they built their own calendar. This was then adopted by all 
	castaways who arrived later, because most of them didn't know the exact date either.</p>
	<h3>early phase:</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<li>0-0-some days BYC: beginning of the stormy phase</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: 4:00 am: A ship sinks in the storm near the island.</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: afternoon: people from that ship make it to beacon beach 
			and immediately fall asleep, terribly exhausted.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 7:30 am: first person wakes up. No idea how much time had passed.
			person starts waking up the others.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 9:40 am: everyone present woken up. Mostly healthy. Attempts to gather 
			status informations.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 10:13 am: Status information gathered: 
		<ul>
			<li>no advanced equipment, only steel knives</li>
			<li>drinkable water available</li>
			<li>fruit, rabbits and birds available for food</li>
			<li>no sign of dangerous animals</li>
			<li>no sign of any kind of human presence</li>
			<li>no short or mid-term ways of escaping this island (probably an island)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>0-1-2 YC: set up of first signal fire</li>
		<li>0-1-3 YC: start hunting wild pigs in the near part of the vast forest</li>
		<li>0-1-6 YC: start of political disagreements: just wait to be saved, build homes,
			or live nomadic and have fun</li>
		<li>0-1-10 YC: nomad lovers split away, however, not many women join them</li>
		<li>0-1-11 YC: nomads split up into two fractions due to cultural disagreements, party 
			with higher culture refered to as wood runners, party with lower culture called
			barbarians. Almost all nomad women join the wood runners</li>
		<li>0-1-12 YC: barbarians split up into two tribes due to leadership disagreements</li>
		<li>0-1-14 YC: home lovers split away into the forest, become beach-side-huttese</li>
		<li>0-1-16 YC: a barbarian tribe attacks beacon beach in order to capture women. 
			The barbarians are from now on considered and called savages</li>
		<li>0-1-17 YC: beacon guards' scouts start searching a safer place for the children</li>
		<li>0-2-13 YC: beacon guards' scouts find Grand castle</li>
		<li>0-2-16 YC: beacon guards children and their parents move to Grand castle. 
			However, most adult beacon guards, which are not parents, stay at beacon beach, 
			because still a considerable number of people strand there every week and the 
			beacon guards don't want those people to be recruited by savages.</li>
		<li>0-3-9 YC: end of stormy phase. Although fewer people now strand at beacon beach, 
			the beacon guards still remain there hoping that signal fires could be more
			easily seen if they were at varios places on the island, not only at grand castle.</li>
		<li>0-4-4 YC: unsatisfied by the current living standards of huttese, some of them split
			away to settle elsewhere. They build a fort on a hill and become known as fortese.</li>
		<li>0-12-25 YC: beginning of a new stormy phase</li>
		<li>1-1-12 YC: since a large number of castaways stranded at beacon beach during the last few 
			days, beacon guards send couriers to grand castle in order to call for troops to 
			escort the newly arrived families to security in grand castle.</li>
		<li>1-3-7 YC: end of new stormy phase. Stormy phases now thought to occur regularly
			every year. This is actually true and due to the season.</li>
		<li>3-3-12 YC: Venice castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>4-11-13 YC: castellan scouts find first cliff-side-huttese village, they are
			accepted there, because they help defending the castellan woods from savages</li>
		<li>7-6-12 YC: Rock castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>18-1-1 YC: Council of castellans decides that every castle specializes in at

	<h3 id="thesavagestrikeforce">the savage strike force, 53-06-17 YC</h3>
	<p>"The savage strike force" was a short-term alliance of three savage tribes to attack a group of castellans. Despite
		the savages not working together very well (still some internal fighting), they were the largest group
		of cooperating savages ever reported.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>Nine years ago, the castellans recruited the martial arts grandmaster. Now, a relatively large strikeforce, with
		every member having ample martial arts training, quits rock castle with the mission to recover knives and guns
		from the savages. They are a little over-confident in their skills and therefore act a little overaggressively.
		They think they can already work towards the known long-time-goal of rock castle: wiping out all savages on
		the island. Therefore, the castellan strike force causes considerable damage to various savage tribes. The
		savages, of course, are not amused by this, and a large grey tribe (that may have been the union of two or
		even three grey tribes anyway) decides to try and rally as many unharmed nearby tribes as possible. They
		get the support of two other tribes (whose colour is still unconfirmed and disputed) and together, the three
		tribes become a what will be known as "the savage strike force", a strike force with the specified goal to
		defeat this specific castellan strike force.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>The savages attack the castellans sometime during the morning or early afternoon. (The historians couldn't find a
		consensus on when exactly the battle started, nor could they definitely figure out where the battle took place.
		Some claim it must have been in the forest, because the survivors remembered frantic fighting between trees, others
		argue that it must have been on savage beach or a hillside because such a large savage force couldn't have been
		coordinated between the trees, and the fight memories with trees originated from some fights while retreating.)
		The castellans don't immediately realise how large the attacking force really is, and decide to fight back.
		Despite the savages theoretically working together, there is a lot of distrust between the members of the tribes,
		and, as a result, they sometimes fight each other and not the castellans, but still most fight the castellans.
		When castellan castualties start to rise, and still more and more savages pour into the fight, the castellans
		suddenly realise that they can probably not win this battle. They decide to retreat. The savages immediately start
		to pursue the retreating castellans, and do not cease this pursue until the castellans retreat into rock castle.
		However, with the start of the pursuit, the trust between the tribes ceases definitely, and the two smaller tribes
		leave the alliance and the grey tribe continues alone.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p>The castellan strike force lost 3/4 of their members, including the commander. The savages too, had high losses,
		since the castellans DID have a large and powerful strike force. Everyone on the island was surprised that the
		savages could form a large group like this. The savages could have declared the whole operation to have been
		a success, but regarding the high losses and the lack of trust inside the alliance, the grey tribe decided to
		not proclaim a great victory. On the castellan side, nobody wanted to declare a victory, although the lieutnant
		refused to call it a defeat, pointing out that the castellan strike force performed a rather good retreat despite
		the loss of the commander, once	they decided to retreat, also the survivors brought back one loaded gun,
		plus the savage losses had been a lot higher. Nevertheless, it felt like a defeat to the castellans, and
		castellan strike forces have become a lot more cautious, and will never again try to fight back when directly
		attacked by a savage army.</p>
	
	<h3 id="firstcenturyjubilee">First Century Jubilee, 100-1-1 YC</h3>
	<p>The "First Century Jubilee" was a giant celebration of the jubilee of exactly one hundret years since the first
		castaways' arrival. The entire island population was assembled and held peace for a few days, a highly remarkable
		achievement.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>In early 99 YC, many people wondered when the the onehunderedth anniversary of the first castaways' arrival would be,
		and if there would be some kind of celebration. The castellans decided to take the initiative and went to the
		all-purple-tribe to discuss their plan: Everyone should make peace for a few days around the date 100-1-1, and meet at
		beacon beach. Everyone should also bring enough food to feed themselves for that time. The all-purple-tribe liked the
		idea, and took on the responsibility to spread the news across the island. The time of more than six months ensured
		that the news could be spread to everyone on the island without exception. The main festivity was set on the first of
		the year 100, but the invitation was set calling everyone in as soon as the storm season starts. Although a little
		early, it was deciden to choose this signal for convenience reason, since noone on the island, even those without
		calendar, could miss this signal. Plus everyone would still need some time to move to beacon beach. The date within
		the storm season of course ment
		that the weather would not be ideal for celebrations, but on the other hand, short after the temperature drop people
		tended to be more calm and less fighting, so this would improve the safety of the whole organisation.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>Two days before the new year, actually everyone on the island was present at beacon beach. The castellans had a special
		guest: An old woman, 106 years old, the last surviving member of the very first group of castaways. She mentioned that
		when she first woke up, beacon beach looked lonely, with only few people scattered lying around or trying to wake
		the sleeping within vision range. Now, 100 years later, the beach looked slightly crowded no matter where one looked.
		It be of note that most people, even most savages, came unarmed (they had hidden their weapons at home) to the festival.
		On the morning of 100-1-1, at 7:30 am (exactly 100 years after the beginning of the known time), the celebration
		starts with a speech by the old castellan woman. She tells everyone about what she remembers of the first hours and
		days on the island, about the many years since, and most importantly, the will to achieve the goals of surviving or
		living on the island she experienced from the grown-ups when she was young. Everyone listens carefully, and her
		speech is written down by some of the beacon guards and castellans, and later turned into a song (for easier
		remembering) by the beacon guards, that will be spread to all fractions. After the speech, the festivity really begins,
		with music, dance, games and a lot of food that everyone shares. It officially ends with sunrise the next morning, and 
		everyone begins to leave in peace again.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p>What is left to say? Well... The old castellan woman died short afterwards of old age, and her six-year-old
		great-granddaughter promised to herselve that she would see the 200-Years-jubilee celebration, if something like this
		would exist. Indeed, from now on, every onehundred years, there will be a Jubilee where everyone on the island
		assembles in peace, and every jubilee, there will be a 106-year old castellan woman of this dynasty to tell everyone
		about the event that lies exactly one hundred years in the past, and everyone will listen carefully, and the speech
		will not be forgotten. In this war-torn little world, there may not be olympic games to make peace for a short
		time, but these jubilees will always be celebrated in peace as long as there are people on the island.</p>
	
	<h3 id="battleoftheburnedhills">Battle of the Burned Hills, 108-5-6 YC early afternoon until 108-5-8 YC morning</h3>
	<p>The "Battle of the Burned Hills" was the largest and most devastating battle that ever occurred on the
		island. Not only did hundrets of people die, also the survivors and those who cleaned up the mess afterwards
		were left heavily traumatized.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>There are two relatively small, but still notable hills close together in the savage hills near the place where
		the savage hills meet the savage woods and beacon beach. These hills are now known as the Burned Hills, but
		back in 108 YC they were nice and grassy. This was the reason why they were thought to be a good place to
		set up a fortification: The hills are not too large, so they are of lesser interest to the savages, but still
		large enough to offer a good hill-bonus when fighting. These advantages where seen by one fraction of fortese,
		who set up their fort on one of the hills already years before the battle, and in late 107 YC by an uncommonly
		large rebel fraction. This rebel fraction had arisen from people from all castles when a charismatic person came
		up with some new philosophy that strongly conflicted castellan philosophy. They had to leave the castles if they
		wanted to live their philosophy. They decided not to go to unused castle because short before they left, there
		were leaps in ship and ballista technologies that made everyone believe that Venice castle would within months be
		able to	fire at unused castle from ships that are positioned outside of the castles firing range. The "leaps"
		turned out to be dead ends in both tech lines after the battle, but that didn't influence anything anymore. The
		rebels therefore decided their fortification had to be outside of the presumed firing range of future large ship-
		based ballistae, and they found a suitable location on the second of the two aforementioned two hills, very near
		a community of fortese that either didn't care about the philosophy or didn't dare to attack the rebels on their own.
		So in early 108 YC, there where two different forts on these two hills. The fortese organized a large assembly with
		feast for ambassadors of many other fortese communities in the region and beach-side huttese villages. The fortese
		wanted to discuss something with the other fortese and huttese that were close enough. Nobody knows for sure what the
		fortese wanted to discuss, since the assembly couldn't be held as the meeting was interrupted by the battle when
		everyone was still feasting, and the president and the other organisers who knew died in the battle. It is presumed
		that the meeting was called because the fortese leaders were worried about the philosophy of the rebels, and wanted
		to organise a massive assault against the rebels featuring troops from many forts, backed up by huttese. The meeting
		would then have been called to ask for the support of the others, and maybe to fix an attack date, but not to attack
		right away (ambassadors were invited, not armies). But this is only a theory, backed by the fact that some surviving
		fortese were worried about the rebel's philosophy, disputed for the fact that other surviving fortese were not worried
		at all. Anyhow, for the feast, there would be the requirement of a lot of firewood, so the fortese went to cut a lot
		of wood a few days before the meeting. They did so in a place a little away from their usual place, since they thought
		that there, they would be in the lands of a different wood runner clan. In fact, they cut the wood in the border
		area of their usual wood runner foe and one different clan, with the result that both clans got angry and temporarily
		joined forces to punish the fortese. Their scheduled attack date was by coincidence the date of the meeting, of which
		they didn't know. During the previous few months, the castellans had grown increasingly worried about the rebels,
		and decided that all castles will send out their armies in an unified attempt to defeat the rebels. By coincidence,
		they too chose the same date for their attack.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>The Battle of the Burned Hills started short after noon, when
		the wood runners and the castellan army attack their respective forts approximately at the same time. They see each
		other, but since they have nothing to do with one another's quarrels they simply ignore each other, which is possible
		due to the attack pathes not crossing each other. Their massive attacks catch the attention of some savage tribes,
		that think, they could snatch themselves a hill if they attack while the high-tech people are still busy with each
		other. Therefore, multiple, not cooperating and uncoordinated savage tribes join the battle. It is unsure which
		tribes exactly were involved, but several colours have been confirmed to have been present: red (no surprise), brown,
		white, grey, and black (a black survivor would later say their chief wanted to wait in the woods until the battle
		ends, so they could attack the weakened winners afterwards, but they were found and flushed out by a brown tribe).
		Some claim to have seen blue somewhere, but historians think that this is unlikely because blue tribes usually don't
		live near enough there to get involved in the battle. It is more likely that some painted shield was blue. When
		the night sets, the fighting reduces to almost zero, since most parties group up where they are, and stay there
		until people can see again. Unfortunately, by midnight the huttese and the fortese who had sent ambassadors to the
		meeting, get suspicious when their ambassadors don't return. Therefore, they plan an attack at the fort, because they
		think that the meeting was part of some kind of betrayal. When the sun rises again, fortese and huttese armies are
		ready to attack, but due to a nasty fog, they can't see what is really goin on, and simply attack the location of
		the fort, not fully realising how many savages there really are, and that the local fortese were not guilty that the
		ambassadors didn't return. Sometime during the morning, weather still heavily foggy, more and more savages join the
		battle thinking it should be mainly over by now. Some of these savages get too far east, and accidently trigger an
		alert with the beacon guards. The beacon guards start firing at the savages, and also into the battlefield realising
		there are very dangerous numbers of savages there, not realising that they also hit a considerable number of huttese
		and fortese. When the fog finally lifts during the afternoon, the everyone sees the huge chaos and the misassumptions,
		and without the need of much more communication, everyone turns against the savages, with the exception of savages,
		who start mildly coomperating and focusing their attack at non-savages, although the cooperation never gets anywhere
		near as good as during "the savage strike force". A nearby latecomer group sees the battle in the evening, and they
		decide to join in to help crush the savages, although they can't do much in the evening anymore. During the night, the
		fighting calms down once more, because the rangers can't shoot and the closequarter fighters try to defend mainly,
		knowing that the savages greatly outnumber the others. Next morning however, when the archers, crossbowmen and
		arbalesters can fire again, the savages quickly get decimated. It is also noted that many survivors of the battle
		claim that in the evening, there were more savages than in the following morning, with reports ranging from 20% to 50%
		of savages having fled through the night. It should be noted that there are savages who reported they had fled the
		battlefield during the night with their tribes, knowing that it would be difficult to crack the defensive formations
		of the non-savages at night, and it would be extremely dangerous to remain until day, when the archers start firing
		again. As a result, the savages are beaten within two hours after sunrise, and the surviving savages flee. The
		non-savages remain on the battlefield, but not one of them is thinking about victory. They all see the devastation,
		and know that anyone who has taken part in this battle has lost it.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p>The casualties were large, for all fractions that were on the island at the time: either the people got killed, or they
		remained traumathised afterwards. Most fractions could mostly cure those traumata, but the savages couldn't. The
		traumata later led to the first occurrence of massed insanity, leading to a	group of mad people, previously savages,
		rampaging across the island. This rampage lasted until almost 7 months later, when the dropping temperatures coming
		with the rain and storm season made the madmen ill, and at the same time appeased them in their heat. Those still alive
		(only a one-digit percentage of the original group) were then captured by castellans who tried to cure them - with
		success, altough more than half of the captured died even after capture from diseases and starvation, despite the
		castellans struggle to save them. The few survivors later joined various fractions, some rejoining the savage tribes
		that they had originally belonged to, others joining the huttese, fortese, wood runners, or even castellans. The
		trauma coping of the other fractions was considerably better, they lost noone to permanent insanity, although some
		people needed several years to fully recover. In order to facilitate the trauma coping, the peoples who lived near
		the location and were involved in the battle moved away, with other peoples, who had not been involved, taking their
		places (the involved beach-side huttese switched villages with cliff-siders, the involved fortese switched forts with
		fortese near unused castle, and the beacon guards in the south were moved to the north of beacon beach, with the
		northeners taking their place). <br>After the battle, and until today, there was and is a confusion about the technology
		level of the hosting fortese: a few wood runners from one of the flanks claimed that their troop had been taken under
		unprecise, but very fast arrow fire by a single fortese on a watchtower. This claim was seen as rather strange, because
		A) fortese prefer accurate firing, so they wouldn't likely develop a fast and unprecise weapon, B) the descriptions of
		the effects seem to indicate that the weapon used was a lever-repeater-crossbow, but this weapon was developed only
		much later by huttese, C) no weapon with the capabilities of fast firing was found when cleaning the battlefield,
		D) the few survivors of the hosting fortese didn't know about such a weapon, presumably because they had no clearance
		to know about new weapon developments. However, the shooter was standing on a watchtower, and this watchtower was cut
		down by the wood runners and the top of the tower fell into the main fireplace, which was still on fire since the
		feast. The shooter must have been killed by this, and his weapon probably fell into the fire and was totally burned,
		so it could be that those fortese were developing a new weapon, a lever-repeater-crossbow, in secret. <br>The savages
		were victims of another confusion: because the battlefield was already cleaned up and all bodies buried when the purple
		tribe's delegation arrived, noone could tell what tribes were still alive, considering the fact that everyone expected
		that some tribes had been completely exterminated. The purple tribe needed months of work to really know again for sure
		what tribes existed, so the information on the wall was unsure for that time, especially considering the two noted black
		tribes, who were expected to be still alive, when they had in fact been almost completely killed in the battle and the
		few survivors had joined grey tribes. <br>The total losses vary between the fractions: The savages lost lots of people,
		entiere tribes were annihilated there. The involved wood runner clans, too, suffered severe losses, but neither of
		the clans was comletely erased. The beacon guards got away more lightely, they lost relatively few, since they stayed
		at the edge of the battlefield and remained mostly in ranged combat against non-rangers. The latecomers also had only
		small losses, because they came only when everyone was fighting savages anyway and their technologies and formation
		allowed them to defend against the savages. The castellan army lost about half of their troops, but considering their
		disadvantageous positioning between the rebels and the savages and the relatively low number of castellans in the first
		plac, this can be considered to be a good job done by the general (survived) and his officers (most survived). Noone
		knows for sure if the castellans had survived if the rebels had killed the general and more officers in the early phase
		of the battle, thus disrupting the lines of command. The hosting fortese were almost completely annihilated, and the
		fort entirely destroyed. All of their senior personnel died, so there is no way of knowing the riddles like their tech
		level and the reason of the meeting. The losses of the other involved fortese and the involved huttese vary, but most
		lost at least half of their ambassadors, meaning many important people (many dictators and presidents, too) were
		lost in the battle because they were caught up in the fort. Concerning troops: some huttese villages lost almoust their
		entire armed forces (basically their entire forces with the exception of those few guards that had remained at home),
		while other villages got away with less casualties. The fortese casualties tended to be smaller on average, but strongly
		varied too. The smaller losses (number or only percentage? Historians disagree on this topic.) are explained by the
		used tactics: the fortese remained in ranged combat, so they tended to get less caught up in the middle of savages.
		Armour technology could also have played a role. The rebels' losses were high too: their fort, around half of their
		people, their leaders, and their confidence into their philosophy. The last is due to the philosophy having developed
		during their stay on the hill, to a point were something about this battle should have been impossible according
		to the philosophy (the rebels never explained what exactly it was, theories are that maybe the devastation, maybe the
		deaths of their leaders contradicted their philosophy). Without their leaders and the philosophy, they rejoined their
		home castles. <br> The location of the battle remains as a memorial for future generations: after all bodies had been
		buried, the (remaining) grass on the battlefield was burned. (They did pay attention to not cause a wildfire!) The
		hills have their name from that event: Burned Hills. After the burning was over, the people put something into the
		ground, presumably salt, sand or gravel, to prevent the grass from returning, and until today, the blackness of the floor
		remains and reminds everyone of the losses of this battle, despite the maybe hundrets of years since. The dark tale
		of this battle and the meaning of the Burned Hills is told every child on the island once they are old enough to
		understand the message. Noone likes to go to the Burned Hills, and if possible, people stay away from there. Nobody
		would get the idea to settle there, neither a savage tribe nor a fortese community nor a rebel group. The Burned Hills
		will remain alone and black forever, and the Battle of the Burned Hills will never ever be forgotten.</p>

	<li>499-6-4 YC: Venice castle launches four expedition ships to all cardinal points to see if there is land nearby. 
			The ships should have quit Venice castle on -6-1, but complications with the food loaded delayed the depart.</li>
		<li>499-7-26 YC: eastern expedition ship returns to Venice castle after not having found any land within one month and
			having grown concerned about the food and water supplies that were designed to last two monts</li>
		<li>499-8-30 YC: Calculating that the water supplies of the northern, western and southern expedition ships must
			have run out by now, Venice castle declares these three ships missing during a meeting of the council of castellans.
			The ships are no longer expected to return.</li>
		<li>499-9-13 YC: Southern expedition ship returns. They had found multiple small islands to the south after only ten
			days, and then lost track of time there, exploring the island field. They report that the field stretches out
			to northwest, but is limited to the east and south. Hopes go up that the remaining expedition ships might come
			back after all.</li>
		<li>499-10-12 YC: One more expedition ship returns from the west. Inside, there were some members of the western
			and northern expedition teams, but by far not all of them. The remaining ones were on one of the small islands
			they had found. The northern expedition had turned to the west, the western to the north, and both followed the
			inner edge of what seemed to be a ring of little islands (a ring whose center is, bizarrly, the main island),
			until the ships suddenly met. They joined forces and decided to return via the route of the western ship, thinking
			that it was the faster route back and knowing they would be back a lot later than expected anyway. Unfortunately,
			one of the ships touched a reef when they wanted to head back to the main island after refilling the water barrels
			one last time. The ship got damaged and had to be repaired, therefore, they had to split the group into one
			troop that would go home with the undamaged ship, and one troop that would stay and try to repair the damaged ship.
			The second ship arrived four days later.</li>
		<li>500-1-1 YC: Fifth Century Jubilee is celebrated. The castellans inform everyone that there are many small islands
			in the distance of ten days travel to the north, west, and south. After the end of the stormy phase, everyone who
			can tries to send people to the "distant islands" for colonies. Therefore, the "distant islands mode" starts.</li>

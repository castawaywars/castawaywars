		<h1>Storyline of Castaway Wars</h1>
		
		place map here
		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>A mayor number of people stranded on the island. After attempts to build a stable community 
			failed due to serious differences of ideas for island and community policies, the group 
			split up into several fractions, which are mostly hostile towards each other.</p>
		
		<h2>Timeline</h2>
		<p>YC means Years in the Castaway's timeline. 0-1-1 YC was the day when the first 
		people arrived on the island. BYC is before this. Since none of the first castaways knew 
		how much time had passed, they built their own calendar. This was then adopted by all 
		castaways who arrived later, because most of them didn't know the exact date either.</p>
		<h3>Early phase:</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type: none">

				or live nomadic and have fun</li>
			<li>0-1-10 YC: nomad lovers split away, however, not many women join them</li>
			<li>0-1-11 YC: nomads split up into two fractions due to cultural disagreements, party 
				with higher culture refered to as wood runners, party with lower culture called
				barbarians. Almost all nomad women join the wood runners</li>
			<li>0-1-12 YC: barbarians split up into two tribes due to leadership disagreements</li>
			<li>0-1-14 YC: home lovers split away into the forest, become beach-side-huttese</li>

				because still a considerable number of people strand there every week and the 
				beacon guards don't want those people to be recruited by savages.</li>
			<li>0-3-9 YC: end of stormy phase. Although fewer people now strand at beacon beach, 
				the beacon guards still remain there hoping that signal fires could be more
				easily seen if they were at varios places on the island, not only at grand castle.</li>

				away to settle elsewhere. They build a fort on a hill and become known as fortese.</li>

				days, beacon guards send couriers to grand castle in order to call for troops to 
				escort the newly arrived families to security in grand castle.</li>

				every year.</li>
			<li>3-3-12 YC: Venice castle claimed by castellans</li>
			<li>4-11-13 YC: castellan scouts find first cliff-side-huttese village, they are
				accepted there, because they help defending the castellan woods from savages</li>
			<li>7-6-12 YC: Rock castle claimed by castellans</li>
			<li>18-1-1 YC: Council of castellans decides that every castle specializes in at 
				least one special topic: Rock castle: martial arts and guns, Venice castle:

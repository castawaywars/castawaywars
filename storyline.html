	<h1>Storyline of Castaway Wars</h1>
	
	<img src="Karte_Castaway_Wars_2_0.jpg" alt="picture island map"/>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>A mayor number of people stranded on the island. After attempts to build a stable community 
		failed due to serious differences of ideas for island and community policies, the group 
		split up into several fractions, which are mostly hostile towards each other.</p>
	
	<h2>Timeline</h2>
	<p>YC means Years in the Castaway's timeline. 0-1-1 YC was the day when the first 
	people arrived on the island. BYC is before this. Since none of the first castaways knew 
	how much time had passed, they built their own calendar. This was then adopted by all 
	castaways who arrived later, because most of them didn't know the exact date either.</p>
	<h3>early phase:</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<li>0-0-some days BYC: beginning of the stormy phase</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: 4:00 am: A ship sinks in the storm near the island.</li>
		<li>0-0-one or two days BYC: afternoon: people from that ship make it to beacon beach 
			and immediately fall asleep, terribly exhausted.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 7:30 am: first person wakes up. No idea how much time had passed.
			person starts waking up the others.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 9:40 am: everyone present woken up. Mostly healthy. Attempts to gather 
			status informations.</li>
		<li>0-1-1 YC: 10:13 am: Status information gathered: 
		<ul>
			<li>no advanced equipment, only steel knives</li>
			<li>drinkable water available</li>
			<li>fruit, rabbits and birds available for food</li>
			<li>no sign of dangerous animals</li>
			<li>no sign of any kind of human presence</li>
			<li>no short or mid-term ways of escaping this island (probably an island)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>0-1-2 YC: set up of first signal fire</li>
		<li>0-1-3 YC: start hunting wild pigs in the near part of the vast forest</li>
		<li>0-1-6 YC: start of political disagreements: just wait to be saved, build homes,
			or live nomadic and have fun</li>
		<li>0-1-10 YC: nomad lovers split away, however, not many women join them</li>
		<li>0-1-11 YC: nomads split up into two fractions due to cultural disagreements, party 
			with higher culture refered to as wood runners, party with lower culture called
			barbarians. Almost all nomad women join the wood runners</li>
		<li>0-1-12 YC: barbarians split up into two tribes due to leadership disagreements</li>
		<li>0-1-14 YC: home lovers split away into the forest, become beach-side-huttese</li>
		<li>0-1-16 YC: a barbarian tribe attacks beacon beach in order to capture women. 
			The barbarians are from now on considered and called savages</li>
		<li>0-1-17 YC: beacon guards' scouts start searching a safer place for the children</li>
		<li>0-2-13 YC: beacon guards' scouts find Grand castle</li>
		<li>0-2-16 YC: beacon guards children and their parents move to Grand castle. 
			However, most adult beacon guards, which are not parents, stay at beacon beach, 
			because still a considerable number of people strand there every week and the 
			beacon guards don't want those people to be recruited by savages.</li>
		<li>0-3-9 YC: end of stormy phase. Although fewer people now strand at beacon beach, 
			the beacon guards still remain there hoping that signal fires could be more
			easily seen if they were at varios places on the island, not only at grand castle.</li>
		<li>0-4-4 YC: unsatisfied by the current living standards of huttese, some of them split
			away to settle elsewhere. They build a fort on a hill and become known as fortese.</li>
		<li>0-11-25 YC: beginning of a new stormy phase</li>
		<li>1-1-12 YC: since a large number of castaways stranded at beacon beach during the last few 
			days, beacon guards send couriers to grand castle in order to call for troops to 
			escort the newly arrived families to security in grand castle.</li>
		<li>1-3-7 YC: end of new stormy phase. Stormy phases now thought to occur regularly
			every year. This is actually true and due to the season.</li>
		<li>3-3-12 YC: Venice castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>4-11-13 YC: castellan scouts find first cliff-side-huttese village, they are

		<li>7-6-12 YC: Rock castle claimed by castellans</li>
		<li>18-1-1 YC: Council of castellans decides that every castle specializes in at

	<h2>important events</h2>
	<p>Some events require a longer description than what would be possible in the timeline. These events are explained
		here in detail.</p>
	
	<h3>the savage strike force, 53-06-17 YC</h3>
	<p>"The savage strike force" was a short-term alliance of three savage tribes to attack a group of castellans. Despite
		the savages not working together very well (still some internal fighting), they were the largest group
		of cooperating savages ever reported.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>Nine years ago, the castellans recruited the martial arts grandmaster. Now, a relatively large strikeforce, with
		every member having ample martial arts training, quits rock castle with the mission to recover knives and guns
		from the savages. They are a little over-confident in their skills and therefore act a little overaggressively.
		They think they can already work towards the known long-time-goal of rock castle: wiping out all savages on
		the island. Therefore, the castellan strike force causes considerable damage to various savage tribes. The
		savages, of course, are not amused by this, and a large grey tribe (that may have been the union of two or
		even three grey tribes anyway) decides to try and rally as many unharmed nearby tribes as possible. They
		get the support of two other tribes (whose colour is still unconfirmed and disputed) and together, the three
		tribes become a what will be known as "the savage strike force", a strike force with the specified goal to
		defeat this specific castellan strike force.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>The savages attack the castellans sometime during the morning or early afternoon. (The historians couldn't find a
		consensus on when exactly the battle started, nor could they definitely figure out where the battle took place.
		Some claim it must have been in the forest, because the survivors remembered frantic fighting between trees, others
		argue that it must have been on savage beach or a hillside because such a large savage force couldn't have been
		coordinated between the trees, and the fight memories with trees originated from some fights while retreating.)
		The castellans don't immediately realise how large the attacking force really is, and decide to fight back.
		Despite the savages theoretically working together, there is a lot of distrust between the members of the tribes,
		and, as a result, they sometimes fight each other and not the castellans, but still most fight the castellans.
		When castellan castualties start to rise, and still more and more savages pour into the fight, the castellans
		suddenly realise that they can probably not win this battle. They decide to retreat. The savages immediately start
		to pursue the retreating castellans, and do not cease this pursue until the castellans retreat into rock castle.
		However, with the start of the pursuit, the trust between the tribes ceases definitely, and the two smaller tribes
		leave the alliance and the grey tribe continues alone.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p>The castellan strike force lost 3/4 of their members, including the commander. The savages too, had high losses,
		since the castellans DID have a large and powerful strike force. Everyone on the island was surprised that the
		savages could form a large group like this. The savages could have declared the whole operation to have been
		a success, but regarding the high losses and the lack of trust inside the alliance, the grey tribe decided to
		not proclaim a great victory. On the castellan side, nobody wanted to declare a victory, although the lieutnant
		refused to call it a defeat, pointing out that the castellan strike force performed a rather good retreat despite
		the loss of the commander, once	they decided to retreat, also the survivors brought back one loaded gun,
		plus the savage losses had been a lot higher. Nevertheless, it felt like a defeat to the castellans, and
		castellan strike forces have become a lot more cautious, and will never again try to fight back when directly
		attacked by a savage army.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Battle of the Burned Hills, 108-5-6 YC early afternoon until 108-5-8 YC morning</h3>
	<p>The "Battle of the Burned Hills" was the largest and most devastating battle that ever occurred on the
		island. Not only did hundrets of people die, also the survivors and those who cleaned up the mess afterwards
		were left heavily traumatized.</p>
	<h4>the prologue</h4>
	<p>There are two relatively small, but still notable hills close together in the savage hills near the place where
		the savage hills meet the savage woods and beacon beach. These hills are now known as the Burned Hills, but
		back in 108 YC they were nice and grassy. This was the reason why they were thought to be a good place to
		set up a fortification: The hills are not too large, so they are of lesser interest to the savages, but still
		large enough to offer a good hill-bonus when fighting. These advantages where seen by one fraction of fortese,
		who set up their fort on one of the hills already years before the battle, and in late 107 YC by an uncommonly
		large rebel fraction. This rebel fraction had arisen from people from all castles when a charismatic person came
		up with some new philosophy that strongly conflicted castellan philosophy. They had to leave the castles if they
		wanted to live their philosophy. They decided not to go to unused castle because short before they left, there
		were leaps in ship and ballista technologies that made everyone believe that Venice castle would within months be
		able to	fire at unused castle from ships that are positioned outside of the castles firing range. The "leaps"
		turned out to be dead ends in both tech lines after the battle, but that didn't influence anything anymore. The
		rebels therefore decided their fortification had to be outside of the presumed firing range of future large ship-
		based ballistae, and they found a suitable location on the second of the two aforementioned two hills, very near
		a community of fortese that either didn't care about the philosophy or didn't dare to attack the rebels on their own.
		So in early 108 YC, there where two different forts on these two hills. The fortese organized a large assembly with
		feast for ambassadors of many other fortese communities in the region and beach-side huttese villages. The fortese
		wanted to discuss something with the other fortese and huttese that were close enough. Nobody knows for sure what the
		fortese wanted to discuss, since the assembly couldn't be held as the meeting was interrupted by the battle when
		everyone was still feasting, and the president and the other organisers who knew died in the battle. It is presumed
		that the meeting was called because the fortese leaders were worried about the philosophy of the rebels, and wanted
		to organise a massive assault against the rebels featuring troops from many forts, backed up by huttese. The meeting
		would then have been called to ask for the support of the others, and maybe to fix an attack date, but not to attack
		right away (ambassadors were invited, not armies). But this is only a theory, backed by the fact that some surviving
		fortese were worried about the rebel's philosophy, disputed for the fact that other surviving fortese were not worried
		at all. Anyhow, for the feast, there would be the requirement of a lot of firewood, so the fortese went to cut a lot
		of wood a few days before the meeting. They did so in a place a little away from their usual place, since they thought
		that there, they would be in the lands of a different wood runner clan. In fact, they cut the wood in the border
		area of their usual wood runner foe and one different clan, with the result that both clans got angry and temporarily
		joined forces to punish the fortese. Their scheduled attack date was by coincidence the date of the meeting, of which
		they didn't know. During the previous few months, the castellans had grown increasingly worried about the rebels,
		and decided that all castles will send out their armies in an unified attempt to defeat the rebels. By coincidence,
		they too chose the same date for their attack.</p>
	<h4>the event</h4>
	<p>The Battle of the Burned Hills started short after noon, when
		the wood runners and the castellan army attack their respective forts approximately at the same time. They see each
		other, but since they have nothing to do with one another's quarrels they simply ignore each other, which is possible
		due to the attack pathes not crossing each other. Their massive attacks catch the attention of some savage tribes,
		that think, they could snatch themselves a hill if they attack while the high-tech people are still busy with each
		other. Therefore, multiple, not cooperating and uncoordinated savage tribes join the battle. It is unsure which
		tribes exactly were involved, but several colours have been confirmed to have been present: red (no surprise), brown,
		white, grey, and black (a black survivor would later say their chief wanted to wait in the woods until the battle
		ends, so they could attack the weakened winners afterwards, but they were found and flushed out by a brown tribe).
		Some claim to have seen blue somewhere, but historians think that this is unlikely because blue tribes usually don't
		live near enough there to get involved in the battle. It is more likely that some painted shield was blue. When
		the night sets, the fighting reduces to almost zero, since most parties group up where they are, and stay there
		until people can see again. Unfortunately, by midnight the huttese and the fortese who had sent ambassadors to the
		meeting, get suspicious when their ambassadors don't return. Therefore, they plan an attack at the fort, because they
		think that the meeting was part of some kind of betrayal. When the sun rises again, fortese and huttese armies are
		ready to attack, but due to a nasty fog, they can't see what is really goin on, and simply attack the location of
		the fort, not fully realising how many savages there really are, and that the local fortese were not guilty that the
		ambassadors didn't return. Sometime during the morning, weather still heavily foggy, more and more savages join the
		battle thinking it should be mainly over by now. Some of these savages get too far east, and accidently trigger an
		alert with the beacon guards. The beacon guards start firing at the savages, and also into the battlefield realising
		there are very dangerous numbers of savages there, not realising that they also hit a considerable number of huttese
		and fortese. When the fog finally lifts during the afternoon, the everyone sees the huge chaos and the misassumptions,
		and without the need of much more communication, everyone turns against the savages, with the exception of savages,
		who start mildly coomperating and focusing their attack at non-savages, although the cooperation never gets anywhere
		near as good as during "the savage strike force". A nearby latecomer group sees the battle in the evening, and they
		decide to join in to help crush the savages, although they can't do much in the evening anymore. During the night, the
		fighting calms down once more, because the rangers can't shoot and the closequarter fighters try to defend mainly,
		knowing that the savages greatly outnumber the others. Next morning however, when the archers, crossbowmen and
		arbalesters can fire again, the savages quickly get decimated. It is also noted that many survivors of the battle
		claim that in the evening, there were more savages than in the following morning, with reports ranging from 20% to 50%
		of savages having fled through the night. It should be noted that there are savages who reported they had fled the
		battlefield during the night with their tribes, knowing that it would be difficult to crack the defensive formations
		of the non-savages at night, and it would be extremely dangerous to remain until day, when the archers start firing
		again. As a result, the savages were beaten within two hours after sunrise, and the surviving savages fled. The
		non-savages remained on the battlefield, but not one of them was thinking about victory. They all saw the devastation,
		and knew that anyone who had taken part in this battle had lost it.</p>
	<h4>the aftermath</h4>
	<p></p>
	
			The area around two hills near beacon beach and near the woods becomes the location
			of the most devastating battle ever: <br>
			One hill is inhabited by fortese. The other hill is inhabited by rebels from multiple castles.
			The rebels are being attacked by an united castellan army. The fortese currently host a meeting of some
			allied fortese and huttese. The fort gets attacked by two different wood runner clans, because some
			days ago the fortese cut some wood in the border area of those two clans (presumably firewood for the
			meeting).  Freakily enough at the same time, multiple uncoordinated savage tribes attack the two hills
			in attempts to capture them for themselves, while other savage tribes coincidentally attacked beacon
			beach nearby. As a result, the whole area became an enormous battlefield. Because the fortese and huttese,
			who had been part of the meeting, didn't return (trapped in the fort), the fortese and huttese that had
			stayed at home suspected a huge betrayal by the hosting fortese, and started attacking the area as well.
			-LAter: more savages join, one latecomer group joins (to pressure the savages),
